# Code-C-
A collection of C++ code snippets, projects, and experiments

🚀 C-with-classes (Academic Journey):)- 
  
This repository serves as a live documentation of my progress in learning C++ and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). I am building this as part of my computer science curriculum, moving from basic procedural logic to advanced class-based structures.

📂 Working Structure 
  

 1. Fundamentals & Control Logic 
Basic programs that use tokens, identifiers, and control structures like if-else, switch, and loops.
  
  
 2. Functional Programming 
Programs focused on code reusability using functions and local/global variables.
  

 3. Transition to OOP (Classes & Objects) 
 My latest work where I implement core OOP concepts like Encapsulation, Data Hiding, and Inheritance.

  
 Examples: 

  
 Bankdetails_usingfunction.cpp,

 Studentinfo_function.cpp.

📝 Concepts Implemented 
  
I am currently covering the following syllabus topics: 

  
Encapsulation: Wrapping data and functions into classes.

Abstraction: Hiding complex implementation details.

Data Hiding: Using private access specifiers for security.

Control Structures: Mastered while, do-while, for, break, and continue.
