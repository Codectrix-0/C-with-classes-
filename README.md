# Code-C-
A collection of C++ code snippets, projects, and experiments

<h2 🚀 C-with-classes (Academic Journey):)- h2>
  
This repository serves as a live documentation of my progress in learning C++ and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). I am building this as part of my computer science curriculum, moving from basic procedural logic to advanced class-based structures.

<h3 📂 Project Structure h3>
  
As I add more code every day, the files will generally fall into these three buckets:
<h3 1. Fundamentals & Control Logic h3>
Basic programs that use tokens, identifiers, and control structures like if-else, switch, and loops.
Examples: Calculator.cpp, max_number.cpp, sum.cpp.
  
  
<h3 2. Functional Programming h3>
Programs focused on code reusability using functions and local/global variables.
Examples: Area_usingfunction.cpp, swap.cpp.
  

 <h3 3. Transition to OOP (Classes & Objects) h3>
My latest work where I implement core OOP concepts like Encapsulation, Data Hiding, and Inheritance.

  
<h4 Examples: h4>

  
Bankdetails_usingfunction.cpp,

Studentinfo_function.cpp.
<h2 📝 Concepts Implemented h2>
  
<h4 I am currently covering the following syllabus topics: h4>

  
Encapsulation: Wrapping data and functions into classes.

Abstraction: Hiding complex implementation details.

Data Hiding: Using private access specifiers for security.

Control Structures: Mastered while, do-while, for, break, and continue.
